			<h3>What communities are participating?</h3>
			<h4><a href="https://discord.gg/swwUqU2gpn">PatchBits</a></h4>
			<h4><a href="https://discord.gg/8P2vwXCCWN">MSAID</a></h4>
			<h4><a href="https://discord.gg/FaM4Mk26Yj">Industries' Collaboration</a></h4>
			<h6>Grinmetall (private community)</h6>
			<h6>- Grinmetall hired a bunch of cats to deal with a rodent problem, and closed off visitor access in the mean time.
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3>Who is hosting the contest?</h3>
			<h4>This contest is being hosted in the Sprocket Official Discord.</h4>
			<h5>The event's managers in particular are Overlord and Colson.  Both can be reached through Discord.</h5>
			<br />
			<h3>What is the deadline for completing a vehicle?</h3>
			<h4>Most communities are using a deadline of July 20th.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3>How are tanks picked?</h3>
			<h4>Tanks are selected based on the Discord ID you enter into the YCC Tank Picker utility.  Your Discord ID acts as a "seed" that determines what is generated.  This means that the results will stay consistent regardless of who enters the ID.</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>My Discord ID is invalid.  What do I do?</h3>
			<h4>Most likely, it is because you're using your regular name, instead of your ID.  Refer to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-">this guide</a> to find your actual ID.</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>Clicking the "get my tank" button doesn't do anything, what's wrong?</h3>
			<h4>The tool uses a mix of Java and PyScript, and PyScript has a small chance of not working.  You may need to ask a friend or fellow competitor to get your prompt for you, unfortunately.</h4>
			<h6>Someday I'll rewrite the website in Javascript...</h6>
			<br />
			<h3>Can I use a different prompt?</h3>
			<h4>You are only allowed to use a different prompt if it proves entirely impossible to build your current one.  The process to get a new prompt is not simple, due to the setup of the competition.  Make sure to prove your prompt is impossible first.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3>How are teams balanced?</h3>
			<h4>All teams will have a max budget size, which will be determined based on the heaviest vehicle selected by a content creator.</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>Is file editing allowed?</h3>
			<h4>The general answer is "no" but your prompt may specify exceptions for your vehicle.  For example, armored cars can have their track length file edited.</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>What counts as "cheating" in this contest?</h3>
			<h4>- Hiding fuel tanks or compartments inside the vehicle to improve internal space.</h4>
			<h4>- clipping compartments into the hull to add internal space.</h4>
			<h4>- stacking turrets to improve traverse speeds.</h4>
			<h4>- Using floating compartments.</h4>
			<h4>- hiding tracks within the hull to prevent immobilization (fenders extruded off from the hull are OK.)</h4>
			<h5>This list is non-exhaustive, but covers the most common issues that can lead to disqualification.</h5>
			<br />
			<h3>What counts as not "cheating" in this contest?</h3>
			<h4>- Using custom compartments to make decor.</h4>
			<h4>- Custom mantlets, so long as they are set to be "hand-cranked" in torque settings.</h4>
