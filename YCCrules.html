			<h3>What communities are participating?</h3>
			<h4><a href="https://discord.gg/swwUqU2gpn">PatchBits</a></h4>
			<h4><a href="https://discord.gg/8P2vwXCCWN">MSAID</a></h4>
			<h4><a href="https://discord.gg/FaM4Mk26Yj">Industries' Collaboration</a></h4>
			<h4><a href="https://discord.gg/ZUPZH5cKbj">The Wonder Waffle</a></h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3>Who is hosting the contest?</h3>
			<h4>This contest is being hosted in the Sprocket Official Discord.</h4>
			<h5>The event's managers in particular are Overlord and Colson.  Both can be reached through Discord.</h5>
			<br />
			<h3>What is the deadline for completing a vehicle?</h3>
			<h4>Most communities are using a deadline of July 20th.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3>How are tanks picked?</h3>
			<h4>Tanks are selected based on the Discord ID you enter into the YCC Tank Picker utility.  Your Discord ID acts as a "seed" that determines what is generated.  This means that the results will stay consistent regardless of who enters the ID.</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>My Discord ID is invalid.  What do I do?</h3>
			<h4>Most likely, it is because you're using your regular name, instead of your ID.  Refer to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-">this guide</a> to find your actual ID.</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>Clicking the "get my tank" button doesn't do anything, what's wrong?</h3>
			<h4>The tool uses a mix of Java and PyScript, and PyScript has a small chance of not working.  You may need to ask a friend or fellow competitor to get your prompt for you, unfortunately.</h4>
			<h6>Someday I'll rewrite the website in Javascript...</h6>
			<br />
			<h3>Can I use a different prompt?</h3>
			<h4>You are only allowed to use a different prompt if it proves entirely impossible to build your current one.  The process to get a new prompt is not simple, due to the setup of the competition.  Make sure to prove your prompt is impossible first.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3>How are teams balanced?</h3>
			<h4>All teams will have a max budget size, which will be determined based on the heaviest vehicle selected by a content creator.</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>Is file editing allowed?</h3>
			<h4>The general answer is "no" but your prompt may specify exceptions for your vehicle.  For example, armored cars can have their track length file edited.</h4>
			<h6>An exception is for continuously-spinning compartments, which count as cosmetic compartments.  Note that these will need a separate gunner.</h6>
			<br />
			<h3>Can I attach functional MGs to my tank?</h3>
			<h4>No, you are only allowed to attach the cannons specified in your prompt.</h4>
			<br />
			<h3>Can I file edit my loader?</h3>
			<h4>No.  loaders must have no more than 1.0M of internal space.</h4>
			<h5>Now, cannons bigger than 200mm will run into reload times unsuitable for our format of combat testing.  Once we receive the entries from our content creators, we'll manually make adjustments to the loaders based on caliber size, only if the gun caliber exceeds 200mm and the loader has a full cubic meter of internal space.</h5>
			<h6><i>Contestants will not need to allocate extra internal space</i></h6>
			<br />
			<h3>What counts as "cheating" in this contest?</h3>
			<h4>- Hiding fuel tanks or compartments inside the vehicle to improve internal space.</h4>
			<h4>- clipping compartments into the hull to add internal space.</h4>
			<h4>- stacking turrets to improve traverse speeds.</h4>
			<h4>- Using floating compartments.</h4>
			<h4>- hiding tracks within the hull to prevent immobilization (fenders extruded off from the hull are OK.)</h4>
			<h5>This list is non-exhaustive, but covers the most common issues that can lead to disqualification.</h5>
			<br />
			<h3>What counts as not "cheating" in this contest?</h3>
			<h4>- Using custom compartments to make decor.</h4>
			<h4>- Custom mantlets, so long as they are set to be "hand-cranked" in torque settings.</h4>
