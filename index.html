		<h1 class="text-center">Welcome to the Sprocket Tools website!</h1>

		<h2 class="text-center">Here you can find a list of tools and utilities for Sprocket Tank Design!</h2>
		<br />
        <p>
        <padlist>
			<h2>Update 12</h2>
			<h3>July 29th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>The website has had quite alot of changes behind the scenes.  I'm gradually beginning the process of stripping Python out with the eventual goal of more Java everywhere, because who doesn't like Java?</h4>
			<h4>Some UI changes were made to remove bootstrapper code.  It might not look as pretty, but most pages will load faster now.  The exception is for the RNG pages, which I won't touch until after the contest ends.</h4>
			<h4>A decals catalog is now available!  This will expand with new decals over time - feel free to send some my way through Discord if you want to see them included!</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 11</h2>
			<h3>July 12th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>It was becoming noticeable that people had a hard time reading the navigation menu, which contained everything people were looking for, but they simply didn't see that it was there.  As a result, it is now much bigger.</h4>
			<h4>The description for the random tank generator has been changed.  Additionally, the outdated changelog page is no longer visible through the credits section.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 10</h2>
			<h3>July 8th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>A new rulesheet has been added!  Refer to this page for additional info about the contest.</h4>
			<h4>Armored Trains now allow for wheels to be file edited.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 9</h2>
			<h3>July 8th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Finally outpaced Satisfactory in update numbers!</h4>
			<h3>There has been an update to the rules for Toyotas and IFVs</h3>
			<h4>Toyotas can now fall under the open-top classification, meaning you're able to ignore some space limitations.  IFVs are now also allowed to be wheeled, meaning their tracks can be file edited to be invisible.</h4>
			<h4>Remember that cheating is still not permitted.  Things such as turret boosters, hiding compartments inside the vehicle, and non-permitted file editing isn't allowed.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 8</h2>
			<h3>July 6th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>The Tank Idea Generator webpage will now stay permanently available, but without the YCC theming.  Check out the (slightly modified) new look!</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 7</h2>
			<h3>July 5th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>YCC Picker RNG has now been finalized!</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 6</h2>
			<h3>July 3th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>YCC Picker now tells you if you entered an incorrect ID.</h4>
			<h4>YCC Picker RNG now treats multi-cannons a bit differently, preventing heavy tanks with a 75mm and 76mm from being possible.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 5</h2>
			<h3>June 29th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>YCC Picker now has a loading status indicator, which should help prevent getting sent into a Sitcom unintentionally.</h4>
			<h4>Other tweaks and stuff have been added.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 4</h2>
			<h3>June 29th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Definitely don't try to enter names into the YCC tank picker now.</h4>
			<h4>This definitely has nothing to do with the new error page that can appear.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 3</h2>
			<h3>June 28th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>New background, even better than before! (there is none anymore)</h4>
			<h4>Navigation bar no longer looks like the w3schools.com tutorial navigation bar.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 2</h2>
			<h3>June 28th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Totally didn't add anything to the YCC Tank Picker, please don't try to find it.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 1</h2>
			<h3>June 28th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>This will essentially be considered the first time the website actually looks like a website... yay!!!</h4>
			<br />
			<h4>Anyways, the RNG has been changed for the RNG tester.</h4>
			<h4>- CDL, Medieval Siege Tower, and Walking Mechs are no longer possible.</h4>
			<h4>- Among Us vehicles now only have a 0.5% chance to be picked, down from 1%.</h4>
			<h4>- Siege Tank has been replaced with "Bunker Buster," capable of higher calibers.</h4>
			<br />
			<h4>The entire website has an updated look.  Feel free to give comments on the new style, and the awesome new background!</h4>
			<h4>A navbar has been added, allowing for new pages to be accessed more easily.</h4>
			<h4>Pages for guides, credits, changelog (which you might be reading right now), and more have been added.</h4>
